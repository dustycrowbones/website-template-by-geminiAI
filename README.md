WEBSITE CODE PROMPTS:

1. FIRST PROMPT:
        Generate a web page in HTML, CSS and JS for small business. 
        Small business theme is sustainable jewellery made out of recycled materials.

        Web page structure is following: About us, Products and Contact us. 

        Create a sticky navbar with logo on left side and buttons on the right side. Navbar buttons for each section: About us, Products, Contact us. Navbar button functionality: on click response with smooth slide down to section mentioned. Navbar button background changes color on hover to one specified in given palette, button text color does not change. Navbar hides when user scrolls page down; reveals when user scrolls page up.

        For about us page create section with header About us and below that text lorem ipsum placeholder. Add also a round image placeholder (round image borders 50% in CSS). About us section should be at least 800px high. Heading and text of this section must be on the left. Image of this section must be on the right. 

        For products page create page with shop-like view that consists of even grid view of 36 evenly spaced product cards. 
        For a product card: create card with rounded transparent border; background as described in palette; centered content column structure; square picture placeholder with rounded transparent borders; line for product name in light font weight; line for price in EUR currency in extra light font weight; line with text: in stock. Do not generate any product names or prices, only placeholders. There must be multiple product cards shown on "Products" page. Size cards so that they are shown in 6 by 6 grid.

        For Contact us page create page with heading Contact us. Create a form with separate input lines for full name, email, phone number and message with 2000 character limit. Make also a send message button that sends user's input to company email. Button background changes color on hover to one specified in given palette, button text color does not change. Center content of this section, display all in column.

        For font use Poppins. 
        Font weight for headings - Semi Bold.
        Font weight for text - light.
        Font weight for price - extra light.

        For UI design use following color palette in CSS code: 

        for website background - #131316
        for all text (except on product cards) - #f8f9fa

        for "About us" and "Products" section background - #35333D

        for product card background - #F2F3F5
        for text color in product cards - black

        for navbar and buttons background - #6F5B71
        for navbar and buttons background to change color on hover - #997080

        Give me full html code, full css code, full js code.

2. EXPANDING CSS CODE:

        css code looks too short

3. ASKED FOR LOGO IDEAS:

        could you give me some logo styling ideas to place here: nav.logo { /* Style your logo if needed */ }

4. FIXING NAVBAR POSITION/DIRECTION 

        please edit navbar so buttons are placed horizontally 

5. STYLING SCROLLBAR

        add styling to scrollbar, hidden until user hovers mouse over

6. ADDING FUNCTIONALITY TO PRODUCT CARDS

        could you add functionality that makes it possible to make show product image bigger on click?

6.2 EXPLAINING PREVIOUS PROMPT BETTER

        no increase size like outside the product card. like bringing image out
